# Projectiles

Projectiles have a defined behivour and we can configure certain aspects of it

Essentially they will travel in a straight line until either `duration_ms` time has passed or `max_distance` has been travelled, whatever happens first. If neither is specified the projectile will keep going until it collides with something (player or wall)

## Projectile struct

Configurable fields:
- `name`: Unique name for the projectile
- `damage`: Damage to targets
- `speed`: Travel speed of the projectile
- `size`: Size of the projectile for collision math
- `on_hit_effect`: Effect given to target hit
- `duration_ms`: Lifetime duration
- `max_distance`: Max distance the projectile can travel

Non-configurable:
- `id`: unique identifier for the projectile instance, generated by engine, always increasing integer
- `position`: Current position
- `direction`: Direction the projectile travels
- `player_id`: Player ID of the player that generated the projectile

## Configuration

Some example configurations

```
[
  {
    "name": "some_projectile"
    "damage": 15,
    "speed": 123,
    "size": 50
  },
  {
     "damage": 24,
     "speed": 70,
     "size": 50,
     "on_hit_effect": "poison",
     "max_distance": 1200
  },
  {
     "damage": 0,
     "speed": 120,
     "size": 50,
     "on_hit_effect": "freeze",
     "duration_ms": 1200
  },
]
```
