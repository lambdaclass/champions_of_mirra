## Requirements

- Rust:
  - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Elixir and Erlang:
  - https://thinkingelixir.com/install-elixir-using-asdf/
  - Erlang/OTP 26
  - Elixir 1.15.4
- Unity
  - Download link: https://unity.com/unity-hub
- Docker

## Suggested environment

- Download the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/es-es/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.403-macos-arm64-installer) for your operating system
- In VSCode, download the .NET extension. Once installed, change the version to 1.26 (the option to change versions is in a dropdown next to the Uninstall button in the extension window)/
  To check if the previous steps worked, go to the VSCode's console, select the Output tab and pick Omnisharp Log in the dropdown. If you don't get error logs in that tab and you can see that Omnisharp is scanning the project, then the config is OK.

## Setup project

Make sure Docker is running.

```
git clone https://github.com/lambdaclass/curse_of_myrra
cd curse_of_myrra/server
make db
make setup
```

## Setup Unity

- On Unity Hub, click on the add project button and select the `client` folder.
- Select the correct version of the editor, by default it will show the version needed for the project but you need to select if you want to download the Intel or Silicon version.
- Once we run Unity if you want to test the game you can select the scene on `Assets/Scenes/TitleScreen` and then running it by clicking the play button.

## Run backend

Make sure Docker is running.

```
make start
```

To test locally using the [game backend](https://github.com/lambdaclass/game_backend), temporarily edit the `mix.exs` file to point to the path to your _local_ copy of the game backend, for example:
`{:game_backend, path: "/Users/MyUsername/lambda/game_backend"}`

To test using a remote server, point to the _github URL_ instead and specify the desired branch:
`{:gagame_backend, git: "https://github.com/lambdaclass/game_backend", branch: "main"}`

## Useful commands
