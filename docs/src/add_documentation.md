If you want to add a new documentation page it is pretty simple , follow the steps bellow

### Using the Command Line :
In the root of the project type:
```
cd docs/src
```
Inside the `src` folder create your markdown document (without curly braces).
```
touch {your_page_name}.md
open {your_page_name}.md
```

Write your document and save it. Then open `SUMMARY.md` document and add your new page as following:
